## My process

Looking at the designs in the design folder, I realized I would need an img and two paragraph tags enclose in div (I made this main).

I reset the spacing to zero with * selector.
To ensure it looks good as in the design, the body display is set to flex and contents kept centered.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I work with google font and various way of importing its fonts into CSS.
Finally use @import in my code, saved me lines of code.

### Continued development

I will like to see more of the @import rule in my projects in the future.
I also want to explore more external fonts.

### Useful resources

font: Outfit - [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Outfit)
